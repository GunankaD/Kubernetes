how to install k8s nginx ingress controller in my minikube docker driver?

ChatGPT said:

Easy way 👇

Run these in your Minikube (with Docker driver):

# enable ingress addon
minikube addons enable ingress

# wait for the nginx ingress controller to start
kubectl get pods -n kube-system


You’ll see something like ingress-nginx-controller-xxxxx running in kube-system.

If you want the Ingress-DNS addon too (for hostname-based routing on localhost):

minikube addons enable ingress-dns


Then add host entries in /etc/hosts pointing to 127.0.0.1 or minikube ip.

Done 🎉 — Nginx ingress is now ready in your Minikube cluster.

Want me to also show you how to test it with a sample service + ingress?
